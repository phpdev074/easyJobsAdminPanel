      <h2>Scope of Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        This Policy applies to your use of all the sites and services owned or
        operated by ConnectE Technology LLC and affiliated companies
        (collectively "we," "us" or "our"), including www.connectetech.com,
        registered URL domains owned by the Company and any of our Company
        social media pages (collectively, the "Sites"). Unless we say
        otherwise, all references to the Sites in this Policy include all such
        sites. This Policy does not apply to your use of unaffiliated sites to
        which any of the Sites only link. This Policy covers only information
        collected on the Sites and does not cover any information collected
        offline by us.
      </p>

      <h2>Personal Identification Information</h2>
      <p>
        We may request personal identification information from you (such as
        your name, street address, telephone number, credit card number,
        e-mail address and/or any other identifier that permits the physical
        or online contacting of you) in connection with your use of, or
        participation in, membership registration for our Website, our
        contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, surveys, forums,
        subscription registrations, content submissions, chats, bulletin
        boards, discussion groups, requests for suggestions, visitors'
        requests for free products or services or additional information
        (including via e-mail to us) and in connection with other activities,
        services or resources we make available on any of our Sites. In all
        these cases, we will collect personal identification information from
        you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us.
      </p>

      <h2>Consent to Transfer</h2>

        The Sites are operated in the United States. If you are located in the
        European Union or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be
        aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to
        the United States. By using our website, participating in any of our
        services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to

        and Terms of Service. If you do not agree to these policies, please do

      <p>You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our databases and servers, although we will always make reasonable efforts to do so upon your request. Please also understand that due to the volume of traffic on the Sites and correspondence received, we cannot make any representations about the timeliness of the making of such modifications. In addition, we are unable to modify your information in the records of any third party who has been provided with your information in accordance with this policy.</p>
